WHAT IS ALTERED?
Altered is an innovative TCG with a new refreshing approach to both competitive and casual players. Set in a universe of rich lore and visual design (influenced by Miyazaki's work and Dixit-like illustrations), this game is about exploring a new, reshaped Earth after a mysterious event, the Confluence, profoundly altered it.  Shape your own adventure, choose a faction and lead your expeditions through an ever-changing world. Be the first to discover what the universe of Altered has in store for you! What really lies at the heart of this revolution is a ton of expertly tailored details — a new rarity system, deep evolving lore, innovative game mechanisms and design — and a phygital experience that comes along with its myriad of life-quality improvements for the players, tournaments organizers and store owners alike.  Born and led from the mind of talented game designer Régis Bonnessée (founder of Libellud studio, known for Dixit, Mysterium, Dice Forge, and Seasons), this project is brought to you by the French studio Equinox, based in Paris, in partnership with and exclusively distributed by Asmodee.
IS ALTERED A VIDEO GAME AND WILL THERE BE AN ONLINE VERSION A VIDEO GAME OR A TTS MOD?
Due to overwhelming response during our Kickstarter campaign, we've partnered with BoardGameArena (BGA) to bring Altered to the platform permanently.  Right now, you can visit BGA and play with all of the six official Starter decks for free!  When the game launches in September, players will be able to link their Altered.gg and BGA accounts, and will have the ability to play decks they've created in their collections using cards they own digital copies of.  As we get closer to launch, we'll share more final details on how this will work.
WHEN DO YOU PLAN TO RELEASE THE GAME?
Altered's official launch in retail stores is planned for September 13, 2024.
WHERE DO YOU PLAN TO RELEASE THE GAME?

HOW OFTEN CAN WE EXPECT EXPANSIONS?
The first expansion should be released January 2025. Every subsequent expansion should be released every 4 months (January, May, September)
WILL THERE BE SEASONS AND SET ROTATIONS?
Set rotations aren't planned for now, but as Altered continues to evolve, we'll look at managing how our players interact with growing number of expansions.
BECAUSE OF THE FABRICATION PROCESS REQUIREMENTS YOU WILL NOT FIND FOIL CARDS WITHIN AN ALTERED BOOSTER INSTEAD YOU LL FIND FOILER CARDS?
Much like a wildcard in other games, a Foiler card is a card with a QR code that you scan in order to register it in your collection. Foil cards exist in each rarity: Common, Rare and Unique. Each Foiler can be applied to a card of the corresponding rarity that doesn't have a Foiler applied to it yet. Once you use it, the Foiler is spent. When you spend a Foiler, it will apply to the card family. That means you'll only need to foil a cardname once per rarity! You’ll be able to trade Foilers over the marketplace just like other cards. When a card leaves your collection via the marketplace, the foil status is not transferred. Cardnames with Foilers applied will stay in your collection forever. If you ever reacquire that cardname at that rarity, the Foiler will still be applied! Foiler cards will also be a part of Organized Play rewards.
WHAT KIND OF EXCLUSIVE PROMOS ALT ETC CARDS CAN WE EXPECT?
2 character "families" in Kickstarter Boosters. • More planned towards the end of 2024 and in to
ARE YOU USING AI TO GENERATE THE ILLUSTRATIONS FOR YOUR GAME?
No, only human artists from all over the world (more than 30+).

KICKSTARTER
###############
WILL YOU BE DOING ANOTHER KICKSTARTER CAMPAIGN IN THE FUTURE?
The only Kickstarter/crowd funding campaign we did was the one for Beyond the Gates, the game's first core set. All future sets will release directly to retail.
I MISSED OUT ON THE KICKSTARTER CAN I STILL MAKE A PLEDGE?
Unfortunately due to our commitment to deliver Kickstarter cards by the end of July, we're unable to let anyone else place Kickstarter orders.
IF I DIDN T BACK THE KICKSTARTER HOW CAN I GET MY HANDS ON ALTERED?
Altered will be coming to retail on September 13, 2024. If you are looking for Beyond the Gates KS Edition, a lot of stores ordered some Kickstarter product, as of today, this is the best way to get Altered KS Edition products.
WHEN ARE MY BACKER REWARDS SCHEDULED TO BE DELIVERED?
The cards (Displays and Starter decks) are scheduled to be delivered at the end of July 2024 and into August. Initially planned for a delivery in Q4 2024, Gamegenic products will instead be available as soon as August. Gamegenic acrylic accessories however will be available a little later toward Q3 2024 and will be sent in a 2nd delivery.
MY PERFERRED LANGUAGE WASN T AVAILABLE DURING THE KICKSTARTER CAMPAIGN HOW DO I GET KICKSTARTER EDITION CARDS IN MY LANGUAGE?
Even though English and French were the only languages available for Kickstarter cards, all KS cards can be printed through the Print on Demand service in the following languages: English, French, German, Italian and Spanish. All of these languages will be available at retail.
WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CARDS FROM THE KICKSTARTER AND THOSE AVAILABLE LATER IN RETAIL?
Cards from the Kickstarter Edition boosters will have a Kickstarter exclusive stamp - the stylized Altered "A". Boosters packs content were adjusted based on the Stretch Goals unlocked during the campaign. Kickstarter Starter Decks will be the same as retail Starter Decks.
HOW DOES A RETAIL BOOSTER DIFFER FROM A KICKSTARTER BOOSTER?
The contents of a retail booster are:   SLOT 1 = Hero (100%)  SLOT 2-9 = Common (100%)  SLOT 10-11 = Rare (100%)  SLOT 12 = Rare (87.5%) / Unique (12.5%)  SLOT 13 = Token (58.3%) / Mana (16.7%) / Foiler (25%)  The contents of a Kickstarter booster are:   SLOT 1 = Foil Hero (100%)  SLOT 2-8 = Common (100%)  SLOT 9 = Common (50%) / Rare (50%)  SLOT 10 = Rare (100%)  SLOT 11 = Rare (98.6%) / Promo 2023-2024 (1.4%)  SLOT 12 = Rare (83.3%) / Unique (14.8%) / Unique Alt Art Foil (1.84%)  SLOT 13 = Token (33.3%) / Mana (16.7%) / Foiler (50%)  SLOT 14 = Common (50%) / Rare (50%)"
WHAT ARE ALTERNATE ARTS AND HOW DOES IT WORK?
Alternate Art cards are cards that exist with a different illustration from their base version. Some of them were unlocked during the Kickstarter and are exclusive to Beyond the Gates KS Edition. Any time those cards appear in KS booster packs, they'll appear as Alternate Art versions rather than the standard version.  These Alternate Art versions will not appear in the retail booster packs and are considered "exclusive" cards, meaning they can only be selected for Print on Demand once per year, making them highly collectible!
WHERE CAN I FIND THE LIST FOR THE STARTER DECKS?
The decklists for the Starter Decks can be found on our website on our Starter Deck product page.
WILL THE STARTER DECKS HAVE ANY EXCLUSIVE CARDS?
The Starter Decks are the only products where you can get the Adventure cards. Other than that, every card in the Starter Decks is also be available in Beyond the Gates. Starter Decks don't contain unique cards.
IF I BUY 6 BOOSTER DISPLAYS CAN I BE ASSURED TO GET A SEALED CASE?
For shipping purposes, an order of 6 booster displays should be dispatched as a case as this is the easiest way to handle such an order. However, we cannot guarantee that because you ordered 6 displays or a multiple of 6 displays you get all of your displays in sealed cases.
I BACKED AT THE DIVINE PLEDGE LEVEL WHAT CARDS WILL I FIND ON MY UNCUT SHEETS?
The Divine Pledge contains 7 uncut sheets with the 7 of them accounting for all the cards of the core set. 3 with all the common cards from the set 4 with all the rare cards from the set There is no unique cards on uncut sheets because they are not printed on the same sheets. Every card is stamped with the community’s choice for the KS exclusive logo. An uncut sheet is 724x983 mm (28.5 x 38.7 in)
WHAT IF I CHANGE BY SHIPPING ADDRESS BEFORE THE KICKSTARTER REWARDS SHIP?
You will receive an email to confirm your delivery address a few weeks before shipping takes place.

WHERE CAN I FIND THE RULES OF THE GAME?
While we have not published a final rule book yet, please check out our Quick Rules on our Resources page for a comprehensive summary of everything you need to know to play the game.
WHAT IS THE SIZE OF THE CORE SET?
18 Hero cards (3 per faction) 162 Commons (Including 109 characters) 324 Rares X Unique cards (Altered from 109 different characters) Permanents &amp; Spells do not have a Unique version.
WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF CARDS IN ALTERED?
Altered contains the following types of cards : Heroes: representing your Hero and their Companion Characters: allies you play in your expeditions Spells: effects that help you on your adventure Permanents: cards that remain in play unlike Characters Tokens: some cards create character tokens Adventure cards: the central map both players will explore along their journey
WHAT GAME MODES ARE GOING TO BE AVAILABLE AT RELEASE?
We'll have 4 official game modes at launch, including:  1v1 Constructed Booster Draft Sealed Deck 2v2 Teams
WHAT ARE THE RULES TO BUILD A CONSTRUCTED DECK IN ALTERED?
A deck must contain a minimum of 39 cards plus 1 Hero card. All of your cards must be of the same faction as your Hero. You cannot have more than 3 copies of a card with the same name, regardless of rarity. You cannot have more than 15 rare cards and more than 3 unique cards in your deck. There is no minimum to the number of Rare or Unique cards you can add in a deck.
WHAT ARE THE 6 DIFFERENT FACTIONS OF ALTERED?
<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal;">Axiom</span>: Ingenious engineers, the Axiom deploy powerful permanents to create an overwhelming late game ressource engine. The faction offers powerful synergies with your Reserve and the Resupply mechanic, along with the might of Brassbugs of tokens and solid removal options. The Axiom can be slow to set up, however, and can be hampered if their Permanents or cards in Reserve are disrupted.  <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal;">Bravos</span>: Headlong adventurers, the Bravos are focused on playing cards that are impressive as quickly as possible. There are two aspects to this philosophy: using cheap Characters with high statistics to consistently move forward with both expeditions, or gaining additional Mana Orbs to power out gigantic Characters way ahead of the curve. The impressive Bravos Characters are often vulnerable to removal abilities, however, and the faction can run out of steam if the game lasts too long.  <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal;">Lyra</span>: Masters of Chaos, the Lyra use a combination of dice throwing abilities and Characters specialized in specific region types to defeat their often bemused opponents. The Lyra always have an unexpected ace up their sleeve, with an array of rule twisting cards and combos. This faction tends to have a hard time playing defensively, and the random aspect of dice throwing and the region types of the face-down adventure cards can come back to bite their players.  <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal;">Muna</span>: Protectors of nature, the Muna concentrate on summoning Plants, anchoring them in the Expeditions so that they remain for future days, then growing them with boosts. These powerful synergies create walls of statistics that are particularly complex to overcome. Muna decks have a simple and proactive gameplan, and are aided by powerful support cards. The Muna’s caregiving and generous nature means that their ability to negatively interact is weak, and their synergies can be negated by well timed disruption.  <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal;">Ordis</span>: The Ordis emphasize the deployment of Ordis Recruit tokens, with a variety of means to create them and powerful payoffs as rewards. These tokens are supported by bureaucrats, Characters with impactful passive effects that will disrupt your opponent’s strategy. Ordis decks can be fast, focusing on boosting their Recruits, or slow and defensive, building an unstoppable force of tokens and permanents. The Ordis can struggle to consistently deploy large quantities of statistics, and usually needs to spend a significant quantity of resources to do so.  <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal;">Yzmir</span>: The Yzmir strategy revolves around their powerful disruption spells and abilities. This faction has access to some of the best removal and draw spells in the game, along with Characters that synergize and help set up these cards.The Yzmir also have access to synergies based around sacrificing their own Characters, to enable powerful and forbidden magic. The downside of Yzmir’s reactive gameplan is that it requires the right answers to the opponent’s cards. Preparation and foresight is an essential step to an Yzmir victory.
HOW DOES THE RARITY SYSTEM WORK?
All cards are members of a family of cards Characters are present as common, rare and uniques Spells &amp; Permanents exist only as common and rares (no uniques) For each playable common card, two rare versions exist. One belongs to the common card faction and the other belongs to another faction and is then playable as an out-of-faction card. Both rares stats and/or effects are variants from the common version. The out-of-faction one is also sometimes modified to match its destination faction needs and flavor. The unique cards are the ultimate alteration of a family of character cards. Uniques will be available in the faction of their Common version, and the faction of their alternate Rare version.
TELL ME MORE ABOUT HOW UNIQUE CARDS WILL WORK?
Unique cards are algorithmically generated, which means their stats, mana costs and other text rules or faction (one of the two factions from the Rare versions) vary from one to another. There can be multiple copies of a unique card from the same family, but all with a different generation of stats and rules. All unique cards are purely unique. The generated one you own can never be found elsewhere in the exact same combination of family and stats/rules etc. This is also true for uniques being two distinct cards with different card names.
WHY HAVE YOU CREATED UNIQUE CARDS INSTEAD OF VERY RARE CARDS?
Altered's original idea is built around the memories many of us TCG players have experienced and loved in the early era of the genre in the 1990’s. Back then, when you opened a booster, you didn’t know what to expect and couldn't find all of the information online. Players were thrilled and excited everytime they would open a pack of cards. Unique cards are our answer to this in order to bring back those memories to the table. They bring the “surprise” effect to the table : unlimited surprises to any pack opening, unlimited deck building possibilities, you’ll never meet the exact same deck twice if you play against different people. Even if you can know most of the cards your opponent might play because a “meta” is known, there will always be a few cards in your deck or your opponent’s that will bring uncertainty to the game. We hope you’ll like this feeling as much as we do.
WHAT ABOUT GAME BALANCING AND PAY TO WIN WHEN IT COMES TO UNIQUE CARDS?
We knew from the very beginning that this question would arise and we decided to implement many features in order to limit the impact the unique cards can have on the gameplay and therefore safeguard the fun they bring to the table.  No more than 3 unique cards per deck. We are giving some hidden limitations to the algorithm to prevent it from generating overpowered cards: a mix of rational game design and hand made work.
IN THE CASE WHERE A QR CODE DOESN T WORK PLAYERS WILL HAVE TO PROVIDE US WITH?
A picture of the incriminated QR Code, so we can access the card history and check who claimed it and when they claimed it; A picture of the booster pack where the card comes from, so that we can investigate with Cartamundi. With that information, we should have enough to investigate and solve the problem.
I AM A COLORBLIND PERSON WILL I BE ABLE TO PLAY ALTERED TCG?
Yes, Altered is colorblind friendly. We hope you’ll love the symbols we have used to help you navigate the game.
WHAT IS THE SIZE OF AN ALTERED CARD?
Altered cards are 2.48"×3.46" (63×88mm), Standard card size.

DIGITAL-SERVICES
###############
HOW DO THE QR CODES WORK?
All cards have their own individual QR code that isn't shared by any other card. The exception is standard art token cards. If a card is unowned (if it was just opened in a booster pack for example), it can be registered on the official Altered app and added to your collection. We recommend scanning new cards and securely registering them to your collection as soon as possible. If a card is scanned and already registered in an account, you won't be able to register it to yours. Instead, it gives you access to the card's information: text, rules, lore, marketplace value, etc.
WON T SCANNING SEVERAL QR CODES BE A SLOW PROCESS?
To make it easier on everyone opening lots of cards at the same time, we are providing a “mass scan” feature that should allow you to scan a dozen cards or more in a few seconds.
I DISLIKE THE LOOK OF THOSE QR CODES WHY DON T YOU USE PRETTY CODES AS I HAVE SEEN USED ELSEWHERE?
We have decided to go with the most basic QR codes that exist because after a lot of testing with the “mass scan” system, they were the one with the highest rate of success. We believe it’s more important this feature be quick and efficient since you are going to use it a lot. We will keep innovating about this in the future as technologies evolve, we also would like to make them fit Altered's aesthetic! Furthermore, we have also tested the inconvenience that these codes might cause in terms of visual noise, and overwhelmingly, users have reported quickly getting accustomed to their presence, no longer paying them much attention.
WHY NOT PUT THEM ON THE BACK OF THE CARDS?
We chose not to have the QR codes on the back of the cards to avoid having to remove the sleeves every time you want to access a QR code. This is particularly problematic for deck checks that are done by judges using their phones but also when you simply want to access cards info for whatever reason (card detail, translation, lore, etc).
HOW SECURE IS YOUR QR CODE SYSTEM?
The system follows the best practices of the industry.  Each QR code hash is embedded in a tiny url format. You need to be logged in to attempt brute forcing the QR codes. Any attempt to brute force a QR code will be flagged and the account quickly blocked and the IP banned. The number of different possibilities you could test is 1.1579209x10^77 (number of atoms the Earth is made of is estimated 10^50 for a quick comparison) We are working on even more measures in case that wouldn’t be enough.
IS YOUR SYSTEM USING NFT?
No, we do not use any NFT technology. There is no need for it and we are aware of the numerous problems they are a part of, ecological ones but also their association with quick scam schemes and such. Instead we decided to go the old and classic way. We host all the data of the app on our secured servers, as any other persistent service offer.
IS YOUR SYSTEM BASED ON CRYPTO CURRENCIES?
No, there are no crypto currencies used for this project.
HOW DOES THE DIGITAL APP AND WEBSITE WORK WITH ALTERED AS A GAME?
The Altered digital app and website are linked platforms where you can manage your collection of cards and find multiple services that facilitate and improve your gaming experience, such as access to your Collection, the Deckbuilder, the Marketplace, the Print on Demand, the Event Finder, access to your Personal stats, Rewards, access to the Lore, etc. We'll continue to add features to make the digital experience even better.
CAN YOU TELL ME MORE ABOUT THE COLLECTION?
All cards you digitally own are available in your Collection. This works like a card gallery, with the ability to consult such specifics of each card as the card’s text, its rules, lore, marketplace value, how many you own in your collection, and so on. 
CAN YOU TELL ME MORE ABOUT THE DECKBUILDER?
The Deckbuilder is where you’ll go to create all of your Altered decks! You’ll be able to use any versions of the cards you own digitally when building your decks, search up the perfect cards for your deck using filters, and register decks in your Collection when participating in official Altered events.
CAN YOU TELL ME MORE ABOUT THE EVENT FINDER?
Every official Altered organized play event can be found in the Event Finder. Players can use filters to search for specific stores, days of the week, distance from their home, event type, and more.
CAN YOU TELL ME MORE ABOUT MY PERSONAL STATS?
Official Altered organized play events can be tracked in your player profile and are accessible at any time. You can see all of the events you played in, your most frequently played faction, the decklists you submitted, your results, and more!  While not everything relating to your player profile will be ready right at launch, we’ll continue to add features to make the experience even better.
CAN YOU TELL ME MORE ABOUT ACCESSING THE LORE?
Every single card in Altered is created with its own lore entry that tells a short story about the card… and more! Lore is designed in two layers: The first is the lore of a card, meant to offer you a short story that’s easily accessible and provides an introduction to the world of Altered and its characters. The second layer is the deep lore, accessible through articles for players that want to know more about each set’s storyline and the overall worldbuilding.
WHY ARE THERE SO FEW FEATURES AT THE MOMENT?
To ensure that the available services meet your expectations, we’ve decided to delay some of them until the game’s release and into Q4. Check out our Digital Features Roadmap to keep up to date with the latest info.
WHAT IF YOUR SERVERS CRASH?
This will probably happen from time to time, as with any other live service. However, the database is secured with multiple backups to prevent any loss of information. Since Altered is a card game first and foremost, we hope you’ll enjoy being able to play with your cards while we work on bringing the servers back online.
CAN YOU TELL ME MORE ABOUT THE MARKETPLACE?
The marketplace lets you buy, sell and trade cards and Foilers with anyone else on the planet at any time. The money used for all transactions comes from your digital wallet. When you buy, sell, or trade a card, digital ownership of the card is transferred from one account to another. In the future, we plan to add the following features:  Bid for cards Loan or rent them to another account
ARE THERE FEES TO PAY IF I TRADE CARDS OVER THE MARKETPLACE?
Yes, there is a small percentage taken from each transaction, similar to any other TCG marketplace. We expect the fee amount to align with other TCG marketplaces, but cannot confirm a specific percentage yet. We’ll update our answer to this question when we can!
WHAT IF I WANT TO TRADE MY CARDS WITHOUT USING THE MARKETPLACE AND AVOID PAYING THE FEES?
We have no problem with one account transferring cards to another for free. We want you to be able to share cards, sell cards, trade cards, give cards away, and manage your collection in whatever way is most convenient for you!  If you choose to do transactions outside of the marketplace, please bear in mind that the payment may not be secured.
CAN YOU TELL ME MORE ABOUT THE DIGITAL WALLET?
Each account has a digital wallet, available in € or $, that you can use for your transactions and services purchased via the app. You can use most payment methods, such as credit card, PayPal, Apple Pay, Google Play, etc. Related fees TBD.
I SOLD MY CARD OVER THE MARKETPLACE BUT I STILL HAVE THE PHYSICAL CARD WHAT CAN I DO WITH IT?
Physical cards still allow you to build and play multiple decks in a casual environment, share your cards with friends or family, and more.
CAN YOU TELL ME MORE ABOUT PRINT ON DEMAND?
Print on Demand is a service from the app and website that allows you to choose any number of cards in your collection and order them to be printed from the official factory, in the language of your choice, and delivered to the address of your choice.  You can print any of your cards as many times as you wish, as long as you own at least one of those cards in your account. “Exclusive” cards are the one exception to this rule. Pricing is still being finalized, but our intent is that the more cards you print at once, the lower the price per card. Delivery fees will still apply. We do not intend to charge you more for printing a foil card vs. a non-foil card.
CAN I PRINT THE STANDARD ART VERSION OF A CARD IF I ONLY OWN THE EXCLUSIVE ART VERSION?
Yes, you are allowed to reprint the standard art version of your card as many times as you wish. Exclusive art versions are limited to once a year.
IS THERE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OFFSET AND POD CARDS?
Because of the process Cartamundi uses for printing the QR Codes on the offset versions (the ones you open in the booster packs), the QR codes are sometimes off-center and do not have the varnish effect. The Print on Demand versions are perfectly centered and varnished.  We are working to improve this process so that, in the future, there will no longer be any differences between the two versions.
HOW LONG WILL I NEED TO WAIT FOR A PRINT ON DEMAND ORDER TO BE DELIVERED?
At release, only the factory at the Cartamundi head office in Belgium will provide this service. As Altered continues to find success, the service should be made available from other Cartamundi factories all over the world, shortening the delays for more and more players.
IF I DON T LIVE IN EUROPE ISN T IT GOING TO BE VERY EXPENSIVE FOR ME TO MAKE A PRINT ON DEMAND ORDER?
We have a Print on Demand feature on our roadmap that will allow multiple users to combine their POD orders together, which should reduce the price per card and allow you to split the delivery fees by shipping to a single address. This probably won’t be available at launch, but we’re hard at work to make this a reality!  We also hope to offer a feature to allow official LGS’s to collect multiple POD orders from their community to submit a single combined order all at once.
WILL I ABLE TO REPRINT MY CARDS EVEN 10 YEARS LATER?
Yes, you’ll be able to reprint any card you own, forever.
I M A COLLECTOR AND I FEEL LIKE ALTERED IS NOT WORKING THE WAY I M USED TO HOW WILL I GET A SENSE OF TRULY BUILDING A COLLECTION?
Indeed, Altered uses a different system than traditional TCG’s. As a collector, you’ll be able to build both an online and offline collection, and no grading of your cards is required because of the print on demand service.  With unique cards, it is indeed not realistically possible to collect absolutely all of the different printed cards. Still, you can collect everything from an artistic perspective (all uniques share the same art). We are also aware that this system will not appeal to every collector, and we understand that this may make it difficult for you to join the adventure if you don’t like the collection system 🙏
###############
COMPETITIVE
###############
CAN I PLAY IN OFFICIAL EVENTS IF I DON T OWN THE CARDS IN MY DIGITAL COLLECTION FOR EXAMPLE IF I HAVE THEM IN THE PAPER FORMAT ONLY?
Official Altered organized play events will require you to digitally own all cards you wish to play in an event. As event registration will happen online, you’ll only be able to submit a decklist with the cards in your collection. Additionally, you must own the exact number of copies of each card you intend to play.
DO I HAVE TO PLAY WITH THE EXACT CARDS MATCHING THE CARDS I HAVE REGISTERED TO AN EVENT SAME QR CODES ETC?
As long as you own any version of the card (with the same cardname and rarity), you can play any physical version of the card in your deck.
HOW WILL DECK CHECKS WORK?
As for any other card game, from time to time, judges will deck check certain players at the beginning of a round.  Tournament officials will be able to quickly perform deck checks with the Altered app by scanning all of the QR codes in the physical deck. A deck check only verifies whether your physical deck matches the decklist you registered for the event. You’ll always be able to play with any version of a physical copy as long as you have any version of those cards in your collection/registered decklist.
WHAT REWARDS WILL PLAYERS GET FOR PLAYING IN EVENTS?
Stay tuned for information about Organized Play rewards!
WHEN WILL EVENTS START?
Altered Organized Play will start as soon as the game releases in August 2024. During the first set, “Beyond the Gates”, all official Altered events will take place at LGS’s, along with a few convention events in 2024.  Starting with Set 2 in January 2025, we’ll expand our Organized Play offerings with competitive tournaments at larger events, our own conventions, and eventually, an Altered World Championship.
WILL YOU RUN EVENTS ON BOARDGAMEARENA?
We don’t have any plans to offer official Altered Organized Play events via BoardGameArena (BGA). Our commitment to physical play will continue to be the foundation of all Altered OP offerings.  Of course, we can’t predict any real-world events that might make physical play unrealistic, and we’re happy to have BGA as an available platform to play Altered with your collection.

A 40-card deck (1 Hero + 39 non-Hero cards) 5 Adventure cards (this is the only place these can be obtained) 15 cardboard game markers 1 folded playmat A basic rulebook 1 Foiler of a random rarity
WHY WOULD SOMEONE BUY PRODUCTS FROM ME WHEN THEY CAN BUY EVERYTHING FROM THE MARKETPLACE?
Secondary markets exist with any successful card game, but that doesn’t prevent hobby stores from selling products. We don’t believe this should be very different for Altered. The laws of supply and demand will work the same way here.  Oversell the product in retail and prices will decrease online. Not enough products sold in retail, and too much demand online? Prices will skyrocket and people will buy retail products. And of course, there are plenty of customers that don’t strictly follow this reasoning and simply love opening booster packs.  Let’s also not forget that opening boosters means opening unique cards, which in some cases will be incredibly valuable and an endless source of joy for those lucky enough to find them.

Plus, with the digital system offered by Altered, you could choose to:  Not stock any singles and specialize in online trading only. Keep all cards (commons and rares) in stock, e.g. in sets of 10, which you could then refill if your stock drops below a predefined level. This method would allow you to offer your customers instant availability for all cards (except uniques), rather than requiring them to use the print-on-demand service and then wait a few days, potentially paying more than the price you would offer, because you will benefit from bulk prices. See “Group purchases” (TBC). You could use this system to offer a “drive-to-store” service where your customers would use the print-on-demand service through you and would benefit from your bulk prices. They would then have to visit your store to collect their orders.
WHAT IF I WANT TO SELL CARDS OVER THE COUNTER AND NOT USE YOUR MARKETPLACE TO AVOID FEES FOR EXAMPLE?
Totally fine with us, the system will allow it.
WHY WOULD SOMEONE BUY PRODUCTS FROM ME WHEN THEY CAN JUST PRINT EVERYTHING?
Cards can only be printed on demand if they’re owned in a digital collection. All sealed booster products will always have a chance for Unique cards — a major incentive to purchase from official retailers.
I M STILL A BIT SKEPTICAL GOT ANYTHING ELSE TO SAY?
Why not join us on social media, particularly on our Discord server? There you can see how our community is already reacting to the game, and even chat with us directly.  You can also ask Asmodee to connect you with one of the many retailers already on board and have a discussion with them.  In addition, you can download the Print and Play version of the game and try it out for yourself.  There is already a wealth of very positive content about Altered available on YouTube.
